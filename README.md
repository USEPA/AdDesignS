# Notes on current software

The **ETDOT** suite of software packages consists of a FORTRAN engine with a Visual Basic (version 6) graphical user interface. The VB6 portion of the code relies on ActiveX control files which are located in the repository, however, these are an older coding standard and no longer supported with current versions of Visual Studio 20##. Precompiled engine files are included.
